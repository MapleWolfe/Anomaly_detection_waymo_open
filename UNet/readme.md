# U-Net Model Creation
This folder focuses on preprocessing and implementation of a U-Net model architecture focusing on targets seen in the WAYMO open data set, more correctly their Preception data. 
The goal is to segment 2D camera images and then relayer the segmentation results onto the original RGB image.
