## Introduction
We aim to develop a model specifically tailored for autonomous driving scenarios for helping an anomaly-object detection system of autonomous driving using the Waymo Open Source Dataset. Our project aims to leverage machine learning techniques to identify and label anomalous objects in perception 2D camera data in order to further enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous vehicles (AV). One such application of our resulting model could be the implementation of a more robust motion-prediction-behavior model based on the types of classifications we acquire. For example, whether the object classified is mobile or immobile and how to react to such an occurrence. More and more people are interested in using autonomous driving functionalities to help their driving; whether for personal use or for business, therefore, it is essential and important to improve the safety, reliability, and performance of AV.

## Pipeline
Utilize U-Net model and YOLO object detection model based on the CNN deep learning algorithms, in combination with an Autoencoder, to identify anomalies in complex open source Waymo dataset. This innovative approach allows us to achieve accurate anomaly detection and localization within real-world scenarios in a 2D space.
