# Wayno_Anomaly_detection_Demo

Anomaly detection in street view images web app - Python Flask
In this part, we are going to use python Flask combined with an html and css file to make a web app prototype for showing the result that if a user upload a image, we will get the upload path of the image just uploaded and give the uploaded image to the YOLOv7 model and U-Net model to give the image the segmentation result and object bounding box, the image processed by the model will be downloaded and save to user's local server. Finally, Flask app code will send the result images to the web page front end together with HTML command.
